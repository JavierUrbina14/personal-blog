        "description": "Hello! 😃 My name is Javier Hernán Torres Urbina, I'm 22 years old, and I live in Santiago, Chile. I'm passionate about technology 💻, which is why I dedicated my life to Computer Engineering 🧠. In early 2019, I began my journey at the institute, where I fell in love with web development and decided to specialize in it 🌐. I started my learning journey by watching videos on YouTube 📺 and then expanded my knowledge through Udemy, official documentation, and other educational platforms. I love putting into practice what I learn by working on personal projects, most of which I share on my GitHub 🚀. At this moment, I have solid knowledge in technologies such as ReactJS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, and PostgreSQL 🔧. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow in this exciting field! 👨‍💻✨"
